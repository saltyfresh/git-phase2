Create a media query that will display the page differently below 600px. In that media querie, make changes such that:

1. The cards display at full width
2. The banner reduces in size
3. All fonts get 50% bigger
4. All the pictures are replaced with their full quality versions (the current ones have '_lo' at the end)
5. Hide the navigation bar items and make it so that the mobile-nav is the only one showing.
